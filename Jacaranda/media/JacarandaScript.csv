She was. He isThey will be an approaching thunderstormShe is a September breeze at his backHe was a suitcaseShe dreams a path lined with purple blossomsHe will be the distance between here and Maputo*She is walkingHe was walking towards her all of his lifeShe is a storyHe was a pile of shoes with the soles worn thin*He will be a songShe will find a purple omen on her shoulderHe was a song, an old song that the old people used to singThey are a field of maize, mile after mile between Harare and LusakaShe is a dusty sunsetHe was a passport photoShe will be the road that rises up to eat the shoes off his feetThey are a blue-lilac-purple atlas*He is a small stone and a heard of goatsThey were the first rains approachingShe will be here tomorrowHe is hopeHe was a talking drum convincing her to stayThey are speaking in tonguesShe will stop and hear him on the windHe was a leopardHe was the story of a leopardHe was the story of a hungry leopard that followed him from Livingstone to NdolaShe is a hunter and a transistor radio*They will walk towards each other all of their livesHe was a walking stick waiting to be found on a dry river bedShe was an eagleHe will be sadza and dried tilapia*They are counting stars*He will collect water from deep in the gorge, the boiling pot of Victoria FallsShe was a vulture on a baobab branch,shoulders hunched over the roadThey are a kudu through the windscreenShe will find a purple omen on her shoulder*He was in love and missing a shoeShe was a dusty brown jacketThey are traveling time and thin from walkingShe will be thundering smokeShe was the Chief but walked away towards Blantyre to follow her purple dreamsHe is an invasive species on the Limpopo*They will be found under a bridge eating purple blossomsThey were a bottle of warm coca-cola from the petrol station in KabweHe was an over ripe mango on the road sideShe is roasted maizeThey are the first of many cigarettes smoked a the Chirundu borderShe will be bright lights and big city bluesShe will sleep rough until he becomes the world in aguavaThey were thrown carelessly over her shoulderThey are the thunder drowning out Brenda Fassie on the radioShe will be a spherical ball of incandescent gas*She is the four giraffes of the Southern Cross as they walk the purple routeThey will shoot the breeze with stones from his catapultHe was the smell of roasting groundnutsHe is. She will beThey were the first rains approachingHe was a waterfall thundering smokeThey will be a Portuguese sailboatShe is a handshakeHe was a sweet goodbye kiss*He is three zebras on Orion’s belt They will take twelve years to go around the sunShe went north with her three children and ended up in BulawayoThey were a ritual and watched the rains comeHe is buried at MaDojeni and 70 elephant tusks surround his graveHe will leave Nkata Bay for Johannesburg, to pray at the banks of the Limpopo and marry in Bulawayo*They had sacred duties*She will be a fisherman on the Kafue RiverHe was drowned by a mermaid and his body never foundShe will remember piles of rotting mangos on the roadsideShe is an unknown birth date and will swear that within an hour of completing the ritual, it will begin to rainHe was born in the line of Chief Zingalume, AmfumuThey will follow the purple roads from Fort Jamison through Kwa Mutokoto pray at the banks of the LimpopoHe will not reach Johannesburg*They will drink warm coca cola in Kampala in a purple tunnelThey are sprawling, undulating terrainShe is the spirit of this placeHe was a lonely visitor with a broken shoeHe will leave stories in his footsteps for the chameleons to read*They were the steep rise that joined the skyHe will melt into the Nairobi sunsetShe was a blue jacaranda not yet in bloom and he is parchedShe will dance mutomboko*She is Lesa, the Bemba creator god of the futureHe is ifikolwe ,the ancestors of the pastThey are walking towards each other all of their lives
